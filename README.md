time comparison versus nmap

- different profiles
    - 65,000 mostly filtered
        mine 16:43
    - 65,000 half-closed, half-opened
first trials:
    blocking
    asynchronous all at once
       - false negatives
       - file limits
            - select
            - os level
    big chunks
        - false negatives

reverse engineering
- nmap reverses and pivots

ease of multi-threading

testing
- possible system tests
